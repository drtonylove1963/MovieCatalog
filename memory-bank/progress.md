# MovieCatalog Progress

## What Works
- ✅ Clean Architecture project structure set up
- ✅ Domain model with aggregates and domain events defined
- ✅ Infrastructure configuration for dual database approach
- ✅ MediatR pipeline behaviors for validation, logging, and exception handling
- ✅ Event sourcing configuration with Marten
- ✅ Message handling with Wolverine and RabbitMQ

## In Progress
- 🔄 Command and query handlers implementation
- 🔄 API controllers for all aggregates
- 🔄 Validation rules for all commands
- 🔄 Read model projections

## What's Left to Build
- ⏳ Complete API endpoints for all operations
- ⏳ Comprehensive validation for all commands and queries
- ⏳ Error handling and response formatting
- ⏳ Unit and integration tests
- ⏳ Documentation for API endpoints
- ⏳ User authentication and authorization
- ⏳ Advanced search and filtering capabilities
- ⏳ Rating and review system

## Current Status
The MovieCatalog project has established its core architecture following Clean Architecture principles with Domain-Driven Design. The domain model with Movie, Actor, and Genre aggregates has been defined along with domain events for tracking state changes. The infrastructure is configured for a CQRS approach with SQL Server for writes and PostgreSQL with Marten for reads and event sourcing.

MediatR pipeline behaviors have been implemented for cross-cutting concerns like validation, logging, and exception handling. The messaging infrastructure is set up with Wolverine and RabbitMQ for event distribution.

The project is now in the phase of implementing command and query handlers, completing API controllers, and setting up proper validation rules and error handling.

## Known Issues
- None identified yet, as the project is in early development stages

## Next Milestone
Complete the implementation of core CRUD operations for all aggregates with proper validation, error handling, and API endpoints.
